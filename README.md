Looking at this data we need to predict the sales for the products for 28 days. The training data that we have consist of individual sales for each product for 1914 days. Using this train data we need to make prediction on the next days.

We have the following files provided from as the part of the competition:

1. calendar.csv - Contains information about the dates on which the products are sold.
2. sales_train_validation.csv - Contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store [d_1 - d_1913]
3. sample_submission.csv - The correct format for submissions. Reference the Evaluation tab for more info.
4. sell_prices.csv - Contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date.
